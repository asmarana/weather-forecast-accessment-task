2. Implement a search input where users can enter the location.
3. Utilize a weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap, WeatherAPI) to fetch weather data for the entered location.
4. Display the current weather information, including temperature, weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy), and any other relevant data.
5. Implement basic error handling for invalid locations or API errors.
6. Make the app visually appealing with proper styling.
7. Provide a clear and user-friendly interface.

## Bonus (Optional)

1. Allow users to view the weather forecast for the next 3-5 days.
2. Add unit tests to ensure the functionality of critical components.
3. Implement geolocation to automatically fetch weather data based on the user's current location.
4. Add animation or transitions to enhance the user experience.

## Submission Guidelines

1. Fork this repository and create a new branch for your work.
2. Commit your code regularly, with clear and concise commit messages.
3. Ensure your code is well-structured, readable, and follows best practices.
4. Update the README.md file with clear instructions on how to run your app.
5. If applicable, include any additional notes or explanations in the README.md.
6. Once you have completed the task, create a pull request to the original repository.

## Evaluation Criteria

1. Code quality and organization: How well the code is structured and follows best practices.
2. Functionality: Does the app meet all the requirements and work as expected?
3. User Interface: Is the app visually appealing and user-friendly?
4. Error handling: How well errors and edge cases are handled.
5. Bonus points: If you implemented any of the bonus tasks, they will be considered for extra credit.
